A good reference from David Terei on reasoning for Go's syntax choices
https://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax


Observations from some reading:

- most work on data description languages is focused on describing the layout of data stored in files or data coming over the wire.  There is less focus on describing the layout of data in main memory.


=====================================
  Design Goals

* Simplicity:        Must be possible to learn in under an hour
* Parsimonious:      Drop features as much as possible
* Interoperability:  Must be easy to express pre-existing C data
* Random-Access:     Must be low/zero-cost to random access to elements
* Cache/Page-Aware:  Should be possible to capture alignment & chunking
* Parallelism:       Should be amenable to SIMD-use
* Control:           Layout decisions affecting performance should not
                     be abstracted out of the users control
* Tabular data:      Database-table sort of data must be handled

  Lesser Goals

* Dynamic Alloc:     Should be possible to add/remove elements, but this is
                     tricky to get right.
* Disk-Friendly:     Would be good if this works for disk
* ProtoBuf:          Would be cool to support proto-buf interoperability
* Tree-Data:         It's not important if this can handle tree-structures

  Non Goals

* Memory Safety:     No effort need be made to make data access safe
* Concurrency/Locks: Should not manage concurrent access policy
* Recursive Data:    If data is scattered around the heap, oh well.
* Maybe/Choice:      Sum-Types and choice are not that important

  Examples

logical Triangles {
  n_tri : size
  verts : [n_tri] {
    v : [3]uint
    n : [3]float
    c : float
  }
}

// this is a trivial, static layout
physical T1 {
  n_tri : size32
  verts : [n_tri] {
    v : [3]uint32
    n : [3]float64
    c : float64
  }
}

// this is a layout where we've decided exactly how many triangles we want
physical T2 {
  n_tri = 5432
  verts : [n_tri]{
    v : [3]uint32
    n : [3]float64
    c : float64
  }
}

// this is a layout that will better accomodate array re-allocation
// We've also padded the layout to ensure 8-byte alignment.
physical T3 {
  n_tri : size32,
  verts : * [n_tri] {
    v : [3]uint32
    _ : [4]byte
    n : [3]float64
    c : float64
  }
}

// Here's a more column-oriented layout, again with re-allocatable arrays
physical T4 {
  n_tri : size32,
  verts : {
    v : * [n_tri][3]uint32
    n : * [n_tri][3]float64
    c : * [n_tri]float64
  }
}

// Here's an even more aggressively column-oriented layout
physical T5 {
  n_tri : size32,
  {
    v : [3] * [n_tri] uint3
    n : [3] * [n_tri] float64
    c : * [n_tri] float64
  }
}

// Now here, we've gone even further and blocked the data into chunks,
// and for good measure of insanity, we're totally ok with storing the
// relevant chunks continuously
physical T6 {
  n_tri : size32,
  chunk_size = 32
  [ n_chunks ; chunk_size ] = n_tri
  {
    v : * [n_chunks][3][chunk_size]uint32
    n : * [n_chunks][3][chunk_size]float64
    c : * [n_chunks][chunk_size]float64
  }
}



=====================================
  Concrete Syntax

<Decl>      ::= <Prim>
              | [<var>|<const>] <Decl>  // array
              | * <Decl>                // pointer-indirection
              | { <Rec>+ }              // struct
<Rec>       ::= <var> : <Decl>
              | <var> = <const>
              | <var> = <var>           // TODO
              | <var> = <var> / <var>   // TODO

<Prim>      ::= int
              | uint
              | size
              | float
      // the following are physical primitives
              | size8   | size16  | size32  | size64
              | uint8   | uint16  | uint32  | uint64
              |  int8   |  int16  |  int32  |  int64
              | float32 | float64
              | byte      // aliases to uint8

<const>     ::= [0-9]+
<var>       ::= <name>    // internally represented as symbols
<name>      ::= _                       // not a name, used for padding
              | [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*  // cannot be exactly _

=====================================
  Symbols

  Internally, we convert variable names to symbols.  In the case of constant numeric array sizes, we use the constant as a name surrogate

<PlopSym>   ::= (<name>|<const>, <unique_id>, <SymKind>)
<SymKind>   ::= VAR
              | IDX
              | PTR

There is a single PTR symbol.
If a symbol has name '_' then we call it a NoneSymbol.
The two kinds VAR and IDX are used to distinguish between a size variable and variables used to index into arrays of that size.

  NOTE: There are still some naming related bugs when there are multiple, nested uses of the same variable size.  For instance, [n][n]float64.  These issues still need to be resolved...

=====================================
  Constant-Sized Array Sugar

  If a constant is used instead of a variable name in an array declaration, then we use a symbol with a "numeric name"

=====================================
  Path IR

<Token>     ::= () | .<Var> | [<Var>]

<Path>      ::= ( <Token>+, <Prim>|<const> )

=====================================
  Expression IR

<Expr>      ::= <Expr>(<Prim>?)   // pointer dereference
              | <Expr> + <Expr>
              | <Expr> * <Expr>
              | <const>
              | <symbol>(<Prim>?)

=====================================
  Typechecking

Typechecking should:
  - check that whenever a size variable is used, it is in scope
  - resolve symbols
  - annotate array declarations with constant size and/or size primitive types
  - record the set of size variable definitions within every declaration
    and the path from the declaration root to that definition

We call the path from a declaration root to the definition of a variable the varpath.  We assume it can be trivially looked up.

In Addition to this basic type-checking, the following judgements can be employed to show different validity properties of a layout:
  - random access
  - alignment
  - path ambiguity



=================================================
  Physical vs. Logical Layouts

Define a lattice of terms { L, P, T, B } (T for top and B for bottom)
Define a MEET operation in the expected way: (commutativity assumed)
  (T /\ x) = x
  (L /\ L) = L
  (L /\ P) = B
  (P /\ P) = P
  (B /\ x) = B

lp_anlaysis( Prim )         = T if the number of bits are specified,
                              L otherwise
lp_anlaysis( *x )           = false
lp_anlaysis( [v]x )         = is_logical(x)
lp_anlaysis({ v:x, rs })    = is_phys_logic(x) and is_phys_logic({ rs })
lp_anlaysis({ v=c, rs })    = is_logical({ rs })

is_physical( decl )       = not is_logical( decl )



=================================================
  Sizeof a layout

The returned expression represents the size of the data described by the declaration.  The values of variables in the expression are not resolved unless they are known to be constant.

sizeof : Decl --> Expr

sizeof(Prim)            = # bytes in Prim
sizeof(*x)              = # bytes in a system pointer
sizeof([v]x)
  v has constant value  = const(v) * sizeof(x)
  v is variable         = v * sizeof(x)
sizeof({ v:x, rs })     = sizeof(x) + sizeof({ rs })
sizeof({ v=c, rs })     = sizeof({ rs })

=================================================
  Offset Expressions

Given an input expression representing an address for data structured by Decl, offset() returns an output expression representing the address for the data accessed via the path of tokens.

offset : Decl, List(Token), Expr --> Expr

offset(  , empty, ptr )           = ptr
offset( *x, () p, ptr )           = offset(x, p, ptr() )
offset( [v]x, [v] p, ptr )        = offset(x, p, ptr + IdxVar(v) * sizeof(x))
offset({ w:x, rs }, .v p, ptr )   = offset({ rs }, .v p, ptr + sizeof(x))
offset({ v:x, rs }, .v p, ptr )   = offset(x, p, ptr)
offset({ w=c, rs }, .v p, ptr )   = offset({ rs }, .v p, ptr)

=================================================
  Alignment

alignment : Decl -> uint

alignment(Prim)       = sizeof(Prim)
alignment(*x)         = sizeof(Ptr)
alignment([v]x)       = alignment(x)
alignment({ rs })     = MAX_( v:x in rs ) alignment(x)

NOTE: Since all sizes of primitives are powers of 2, all alignment values will always be powers of 2.  We rely on this assumption in the following.

The following function finds the largest divisor of an expression that is also a power of 2.

g2d( c )      = greatest power of 2 dividing c
g2d( v )      = 1
g2d( x() )    = infinity
g2d( x + y )  = MIN( g2d(x), g2d(y) )
g2d( x * y )  = g2d(x) * g2d(y)

NOTE: We assume that the expression has been constant propagated already.

To determine whether or not a given declaration is aligned, we use this function that fuses offset() together with a series of alignment checks.

is_aligned : Decl, Expr --> True?

is_aligned( Prim, addr )          = alignment(Prim) divides g2d(addr)
is_aligned(  * x, addr )          =    alignment(*) divides g2d(addr)
                                and  is_aligned( x, addr() )
is_aligned( [v]x, addr )          =    alignment(x) divides g2d(sizeof(x))
                                and    alignment(x) divides g2d(addr)
                                and  is_aligned( x, addr + sizeof(x) * Idx(v) )
is_aligned({ v=c, rs }, addr )    =  is_aligned( { rs }, addr )
is_aligned({ v:x, rs }, addr )    =  alignment(x) divides g2d(addr)
                                and  is_aligned( x, addr )
                                and  is_aligned( { rs }, addr + sizeof(x) )

=================================================
  Expression Expansion

We define a generic notion of expression substitution/recursive-expansion.  In order to specialize this generic notion, we need an _interpretation_ of an expression into an object of type X as a collection of functions

Interpretation(X) =
  deref     : X,Prim --> X
  add       : X,X --> X
  mul       : X,X --> X
  variable  : symbol,Prim --> Maybe(X)
  const     : uint --> X
  default   : () --> X    // 0 arguments (used in event of error)
  ptr       : () --> X    // 0 arguments

Then an expansion of an expression is defined as 

expand : Decl, Interpretation(X), Expr --> X

(the first argument is the root declaration for the expansion; the values of size variables can be looked up from there, and the X returned by I.ptr() is assumed to represent a pointer to this root)

expand( r, I, e1 + e2 )   = I.add( expand(r,I,e1), expand(r,I,e2) )
expand( r, I, e1 * e2 )   = I.mul( expand(r,I,e1), expand(r,I,e2) )
expand( r, I, c )         = I.const( c )
expand( r, I, e(p) )      = I.deref( expand(r,I,e), p )
expand( r, I, sym(p) )
  Check for infinite recursion on sym
  sym == PTR ?            = I.ptr()
  let V = I.variable(sym,p)
  CASES   V == SOME(x)  = x
          V == NONE     = I.deref( expand(r,I,offset(r, varpath(r,sym), PTR),
                                   p )

=================================================
  Random Access

Consider the set of paths in a declaration

  paths(decl)

Then, for each such path p, we try to expand it using the interpretation
RA_Interp
  deref(x,p)      = void
  add(x,x)        = void
  mul(x,x)        = void
  variable(n,p)   = if IDX_SYM(n) then SOME(void) else NONE
  const(c)        = void
  default         = void
  ptr             = void

If expand(decl, RA_Interp, p) detects an infinite recursion then we report back that the declaration is not randomly-accessible.  Since this infinite recursion is detected based on some size variable, we can also report which size variable is not randomly-accessible.


=================================================
  Paths of a Declaration

A Path Set can be pre-pended by a token, which we write
  token..pset
Two path sets can be agglomerated, which we write
  pset1 U pset2
A set with a single path, with no tokens and terminator of a given type may be constructed as
  { prim | const }


paths : Decl --> { Path }   // a set of paths

paths(Prim)         = {Prim}
paths(*x)           = ()..paths(x)
paths([v]x)         = [IdxSym(v)]..paths(x)
paths({ v:x, rs })  = (.v .. paths(x)) U paths({ rs })
paths({ v=c, rs })  =  (.v .. { c })   U paths({ rs })

=================================================
  Normalized Paths and Subpaths

A path consists of a series of tokens and a terminating primitive or constant

To normalize a path, simply
  1. drop all dereference tokens (),
  2. sort all the remaining tokens so that all Field s precede all Index s
  3. sort all Field tokens by alphanumeric string order
  4. sort all Index tokens by alphanumeric string order

Let NP(decl) denote the set of normalized paths in a declaration.

=================================================
  Ambiguous Path Sets

We say that one path is a subpath of another path  p1 < p2  iff. the Field token prefix of normalized(p1) is a sub-sequence of the Field token prefix of normalized(p2).

If a path set contains two distinct paths p1 and p2 s.t. p1 < p2, then we say that the path set is _ambiguous_

Ambiguous path sets are detected and rejected by the typechecker.

=================================================
  Logical Sub-typing

As is usually the case with sub-typing, it should be defined based on the ability of the sub-type to fulfill all operations that are available on the super-type.

Note that every full access to a leaf-primitive in the layout is accomplished via a path.  Therefore, we use paths as a proxy for the set of operations available.

Def: D1 is a sub-type of D2 iff.
  for each (normalized) path p2=(tkns, T2) in NP(D2),
    there is a unique (normalized) path p1=(tkns,T1) in NP(D1),
      s.t. T1 is a sub-type of T2.

Specifically
  size8, size16, ... are subtypes of size
  likewise for every other bit-annotated type
  no bit-annotated types are subtypes of any other distinct bit-annotated type



=================================================
  Physical Cursors






=================================================
  Logical Cursors


when something gets peeled away in a logical cursor access,
we need to clarify what that corresponds to...










We can also establish a re-mapping from paths of one layout to paths of another







two entry points to the library:
1)  Terra DSL interface
2)  PlopLib namespace (i.e. Lua table)


PlopLib.is_layout(obj)    -- Lua Representation of Layout
  layout:is_physical()
  layout:is_logical()

  layout:is_ptr()
    layout:deref()
  layout:is_array()
    layout:arraysize()
    layout:arrayelem()
  layout:is_struct()
    layout:fields()
  layout:is_prim()

PlopLib




PlopLib.is_physical(obj)  -- is a physical layout
  -- ALIASES for CURSOR ROUTINES
  layout.sizeof()
  layout.alloc( alloc_func, [sizes] )
  layout.free( cursor, free_func )

PlopLib.is_logical(obj)
  layout(physical_layout) -- yields a specialized logical layout
  layout:is_specialized()




PlopLib.is_cursor(obj)
layout:cursor()           -- Terra struct for manipulating the Layout
  cursor.layout()

  cursor:ptr()      should return the pointer stored in the cursor
  cursor:sizeof()   should return the size of the data pointed to
  cursor()          for pointer-type cursors, returns a cursor to deref
  cursor(idx_num)   for array-type cursors, returns a cursor to element
  cursor.field      for struct-type cursors, returns a cursor to 'field'
    (idx_num) and .field will also work for a cursor that's a pointer
      to an array or struct correspondingly

  cursor.New( ptr, [freevars] )

  ( ptr cursors only )
  cursor:alloc( alloc_func, [sizes] )
  cursor:free( free_func )

  ( cursors to all other non-primitive layouts )
  cursor.alloc( alloc_func, [sizes] )
  cursor.free( cursor, free_func )
